I want to get the ball rolling on an open-source video game project.

I will detail my (still evolving) vision for the game below and include links to sources of inspiration:

> ["Myth: The Fallen Lords"][1] and its sequel ["Myth II: Soulblighter"][2] are two of the best video games
> I've ever played, and I would be happy simply making a clone of Myth because I have yet to see a game quite
> like it in the ~17 years since the game debuted. In fact, if we can make a simple mini-game that replicates
> the satisfaction of tossing explosive molotov cocktails into the middle of a horde of zombies, I'd be extatic.
> So, maybe that's the best place to start.
>
> This being an open-source project, it's natural to leverage an open community of crators to build content.
> Not just those who can code, but artists, designers, and even players. With that in mind, it might make
> more sense to make something based around content creation, like [Minecraft][3]. I definitely think the idea
> of user-generated content (UGC) should be a major aspect of this game, but how?
>
> First of all, The name of this project is a reference to an indie game currently under development named,
> ["Limit Theory"][4]: a space exploration game inwhich all the content is procedurally generated. The idea of
> Game Theory is that everything is procedurally generated by default and over-ridden by UGC. That way,
> content creators can specify only what they care about and let the procedural generators fill in the
> rest. You made a cool model, but don't want to bother with textures or animation? Game theory fills in
> those blanks procedurally (your milage may vary).
>
> Secondly, we'll take some inspiriation from [Eve's][5] attempt (albeit failed) to create two different games
> that [share the same universe][6]. And make one universe that is a hub to many different games that affect
> eachother. Imagine you like city builders, your friend likes RTS games, and your other friend likes crafting
> games. You form a guild and the RTS guy fights battles to claim achorage for the city builder who provides
> resources to the crafter who crafts robots for the RTS guy. The bottom line is, this approach would allow us
> to connect seemingly disparate mechanics (like Myth-style battles, and Minecraft-style crafting) into a
> single universe helping make in-game content generation viable.
>
> All of this requires some discussion and fleshing out.
