I want to get the ball rolling on an open-source video game project.

I will detail my (still evolving) vision for the game below and include links to sources of inspiration:

> ["Myth: The Fallen Lords"][1] and its sequel ["Myth II: Soulblighter"][2] are two of the best video games
> I've ever played, and I would be happy simply making a clone of Myth because I have yet to see a game quite
> like it in the ~17 years since the game debuted. In fact, if we can make a simple mini-game that [replicates
> the satisfaction of tossing explosive molotov cocktails into the middle of a horde of zombies][3], I'd be extatic.
> So, maybe that's the best place to start.
>
> This being an open-source project, it's natural to leverage an open community of creators to build content.
> Not just those who can code, but artists, designers, and even players. With that in mind, it might make
> more sense to make something based around content creation, like [Minecraft][4]. I definitely think the idea
> of user-generated content (UGC) should be a major aspect of this game, but how?
>
> First of all, The name of this project is a reference to an indie game currently under development named,
> ["Limit Theory"][5]: a space exploration game inwhich all the content is procedurally generated. The idea of
> Game Theory is that everything is procedurally generated by default and over-ridden by UGC. That way,
> content creators can specify only what they care about and let the procedural generators fill in the
> rest. You made a cool model, but don't want to bother with textures or animation? Game theory fills in
> those blanks procedurally (your milage may vary).
>
> Secondly, we'll take some inspiriation from [Eve's][6] attempt (albeit failed) to create two different games
> that [share the same universe][7]. And make one universe that is a hub to many different games that affect
> eachother. Imagine you like city builders, your friend likes RTS games, and your other friend likes crafting
> games. You form a guild and the RTS guy fights battles to claim achorage for the city builder who provides
> resources to the crafter who crafts robots for the RTS guy. The bottom line is, this approach would allow us
> to connect seemingly disparate mechanics (like Myth-style battles, and Minecraft-style crafting) into a
> single universe helping make in-game content generation viable.
>
> All of this requires some discussion and fleshing out.

Thoughts on the Engine and Language:

> I'd rather worry about experimenting with game mechanics than worrying about the details of an engine, so I
> think we should start things out with [Unity Engine][8] for the mean time. There are some [amazing looking engines
> out there][9] that I would love to use (or replicate) but that is beyond the forseable scope.
>
> I'd like to implement the base logic of the game in Python 3 because of its readability, portability, and lack
> of noise (like compiler directives, type declaration, and brackets). The trade off with Python is performance,
> but I view choosing a language for its performance characteristics is a form of pre-optimization. The work flow
> of building the minimal working system, then itterating, then tuning performance is easy in Python because once
> you have identified performance bottle-necks there are many tools to optimize the performancethose specific
> areas after the fact. You can use [Cython][10], [PyPy][11], [Theano][12], and many other tools. I think probably the
> best practice would be to build a system in Python, then optimize by in-lining [Julia][13] in critical areas.
> Julia is a language that reads a lot like Python, but performs a lot like C. The kicker is that there are tools
> that make [in-lining Julia in Python code and Python in Julia code][14] almost seamless.
>
> The biggest problem with this plan is that Unity API is C#-based, so either I need to learn C# and abandon my
> dreams of this project being Python-based, or write some python wrappers for the Unity API.

More details about mechanics:

> I imagine a shared, open world where each person controls a small party instead of a single character. Each character
> in their party represents an account in a different game. You might download the crafting game, create an account,
> and start out as a single-person party with a crafter in it. You can play the crafting game and generate resources
> that help your character advance (like experience) and resources that you can sell (like crafted goods). The catch is
> that you have to pay NPCs to perform all the other tasks in the game for you (like collecting resources or providing
> protection or building and managing the town). This represents a resource tax that significantly slows your progress.
>
> You can download the RTS game and add a military leader to your group, but when you're logged in to that account, the
> crafter will output a constant rate of resources based on their level, but they will not gain experience. The bonus is
> that your RTS character can provide protecton for your crafting character and your crafting character can provide
> gear and units to your RTS character. You can then team up with a friend playing a city builder and aleviate her need
> to pay for an NPC army and NPC industry workers. By working together you achive a lot more and accelerate eachothers
> progression. You build your own guild with its own settlements, industry, boarders, etc.
>
> As we build more games, we replace work done by NPCs with work done by players. If your guild has multiple settlements
> Transporting resources between them might at first involve paying NPC traders, but eventually we release a game like
> [Escape Velocity][15] (a big inspiration for Eve online) that allows players to take part in trading and fending off
> pirates.
